## Project Setup

If you want to preview the changes locally, you will need to setup the project locally. Adding or editing a new member doesn't require setting up the project locally, simply modify markdown files in `content/1.members` directory.

You will need to install nodejs and run the project with a package manager. Nodejs comes with `npm`, you can use it. But I recommend [`bun`](https://bun.sh/) as it's much faster.

::code-group

```bash [bun]
bun install     # install dependencies
bun dev         # start dev server
bun generate    # generate static files
```

```bash [npm]
npm install
npm run dev
npm run generate
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn install
yarn dev
yarn generate
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm install
pnpm dev
pnpm generate
```

## Add A New Member

Go to `content/1.members` directory, based on the member's role, add a new markdown file in the corresponding directory. For example, if you want to add a new faculty member, you should add a new markdown file in `content/1.members/faculty` directory. The markdown file should have the following format:

```markdown
---
name: Huakun Shen
description: Master Student
avatar: https://github.com/HuakunShen.png
website: https://huakunshen.com
# website: /members/grad-student/huakun-shen
email: huakun.shen@huakunshen.com
year: 2023 # necessary for an alumni
---

Anything about yourself.
```

::alert{type="warning"}
Only `name` field is necessary, other fields are all optional.
::

::alert{type="warning"}
For alumnis, `year` field is necessary as it will be used to sort alumnis by year.

### Avatar

It can be a remote image, or a local image. If it's a local image, you should put it in `public/avatar` directory, and use the relative path as the value of `avatar` field. For example, if you put the image in `public/avatar/shen.png`, then the value of `avatar` field should be `/avatar/shen.png`.

### Website

If you include the `website` field, clicking on your avatar will link to the website you specified.

Otherwise it by default will link to your profile on this website.

<details>
<summary>More Details</summary>

For the `website` field, you can put a complete url that start with `https://`, or use a relative path to link to your profile on this website in case you don't have a website yet.

For example, if you want to link to `https://huakunshen.com`, you can put `https://huakunshen.com` or `/members/grad-student/huakun-shen` as the value of `website` field.

The relative path is just the file path of your markdown file relative to the `content` folder (but without the numbers, the numbers is only for sorting). For example, if your markdown file is at `content/1.members/3.grad-student/Huakun-Shen.md`, then the relative path is `/members/grad-student/huakun-shen`.

However, the website has been configured to auto link to your profile on this website if a `website` field is not specified. So you can just leave it blank if you don't have a website yet.

### Content

You can add more details about yourself in the markdown file if you want. Standard markdown syntax is fully supported.

This site is built with [`@nuxt/content`](https://content.nuxt.com/) and [`docus`](https://docus.dev/) theme, which gives you more flexibility to customize the content and styling. In markdown, you can write `html` and `css`. [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) is supported to make styling easier.

For example `<span class="bg-red-300">Hello World</span>` gives you <span class="bg-red-500">Hello World</span>.

Read https://docus.dev/api/components for built-in components you can use. Read author's example at `content/1.members/3.grad-student/Huakun-Shen.md`.

## Editing Your Content

Simple content modification can be done fully in browser without a dev environment. In the documentation page, there is a "Edit this page" button at the bottom of the page. Click it to edit the markdown file of the current page.
