Vladyslav Nekriach

#description
Hi! I'm a MASc student at the UofT ECE department and I'm jointly supervised by Prof. Fan Long from DCS UofT and Prof. Andreas Veneris from ECE UofT. My research interests span distributed systems, blockchain and finance. In my spare time, I usually go to the gym, listen to music or play the guitar; currently learning how to use a DJ controller!
